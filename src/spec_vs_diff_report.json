  "summary": "The diff adds a new LaundryPriceCalculator component and mounts it in App.tsx. Core pricing math and non-negative/invalid input handling appear implemented, but there is evidence the quantity inputs may not actually display a default value of 0 due to rendering 0 as an empty string. Several unrelated UI/theme/docs changes also appear.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-1",
      "requirement": "Each quantity input defaults to 0 (visible as 0) on first load.",
      "reason": "In the new calculator component, the input value is set to `shirtQty || ''` (and similarly for other quantities). Since `0` is falsy, the rendered value becomes an empty string rather than 0, which conflicts with the AC that inputs default to 0.",

    {
      "description": "Added lucide-react icons and extensive decorative styling (gradients, themed cards) for calculator items.",

    {
