  "summary": "Diff adds a Customer Name field with React state and client-side validation to the Laundry order flow, and extends WhatsApp message composition to include a Name line while keeping the destination number constant. However, the WhatsApp message template introduces emoji characters not requested and may violate the “all user-facing text in English” constraint.",

      "description": "WhatsApp message formatting now includes emoji glyphs (e.g., 📋, 🧺, 💰) in the prefilled message template, which was not requested and may conflict with the constraint to keep all user-facing text in English.",
      "reason": "BuildRequest only asked to include a \"Name:\" line and maintain existing details; it did not request adding emojis or changing message styling beyond adding the name line.",
